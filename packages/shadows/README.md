# Shadows

Shadow styles can be used for components like toasts, drawers, modals, layers, tours, tooltips, pop-outs, cards, hover interactions, or focus states.

Card shadow naming convention and the spread and offset logic are based on the [tachyon box-shadow approach](https://tachyons.io/docs/themes/box-shadow/), with the exception of shadow 1 or card shadow.
