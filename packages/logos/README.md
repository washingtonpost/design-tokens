# Logos

This package includes:
- The Washington Post logo
- The WP mark 
- Tooled Washington Post logo
- Voraciously logo
- By The Way logo
- Elections logo
- Comments mark

## Usage
Logo fill color should not change from what is defined in the SVG unless otherwise specified. Logos with a solid or single color fill can change to a color an accessible brand color.

The tooled Washington Post logo should be used sparingly. It is intended for our paper and website masthead. In other cases, use the flat logos.

### React
We use the SVGR library to process SVG files into React components. See the `npm run svgs-react`.
